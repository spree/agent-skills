# Spree Order Totals

A cart's or order's `total` is assembled from **typed money rows** — there is no polymorphic `Spree::Adjustment`. Each kind of money has its own table, its own denormalized sum on the purchase, and a single workflow that keeps them consistent.

> Coming from 5.x adjustments? See `spree-upgrade-5-to-6` (`spree:migrate_adjustments_to_typed_rows`).

## The formula

```
total = item_total + delivery_total + adjustment_total
adjustment_total = (all discount rows) + fee_total + additional_tax_total
```

| Column (Cart & Order) | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `item_total` | Σ line item `amount` (price × quantity), before discounts/tax |
| `delivery_total` | Σ fulfillment `cost` (the selected delivery rates) |
| `discount_total` | Σ **promotion** discount rows (negative) — manual discounts are *not* in it (see Gotchas) |
| `fee_total` | Σ fee rows (always ≥ 0), duties included |
| `additional_tax_total` | Σ tax lines with `included: false` — added on top |
| `included_tax_total` | Σ tax lines with `included: true` — **already inside** prices; informational |
| `adjustment_total` | discounts + fees + additional tax |
| `total` | What the customer pays |
| `payment_total` | Captured payments minus refunds |
| `tax_total` (method) | `included_tax_total + additional_tax_total` |
| `amount_due` (method) | `max(total − payment_total − applied store credit, 0)` |

Line items and fulfillments carry their own per-adjustable columns (`discount_total`, `included_tax_total`, `additional_tax_total`, `adjustment_total`, `taxable_adjustment_total` = discounts, `non_taxable_adjustment_total` = fees, `pre_tax_amount`) so per-line math and returns don't need to re-query rows.

Placed marketplace orders also carry `commission_amount_total` / `commission_tax_total` / `commission_total` — charged to the seller, **never** part of `total` (see `spree-marketplace`).

## The typed rows

All three include `Spree::TypedAdjustmentLine`: dual `cart_id` / `order_id` owner (exactly one — read `row.owner`), `label`, `amount` (+ `display_amount`), `metadata`.

| Model (prefix) | Attaches to (exactly one…) | Kinds | Sign | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Spree::TaxLine` (`tl_`) | line item, fulfillment, **or fee** | — (`included` true/false, `taxability_reason`) | ≥ 0 | The tax provider only (see `spree-taxes`) |
| `Spree::Discount` (`disc_`) | line item **or** fulfillment | `promotion`, `manual` | ≤ 0 | Promotion adjuster; admin (`manual`) |
| `Spree::Fee` (`fee_`) | line item, fulfillment, **or neither** (order-level) | `surcharge`, `handling`, `gift_wrap`, `cod`, `payment`, `duty` (extensible) | ≥ 0 | Adjusters, integrations, admin |

- **No order-level discount rows.** An order-wide promotion or manual discount is spread across line items by largest-remainder over each line's discounted base — which is what makes a partial return refund the right share without guessing.
- Rows **snapshot their provenance**: a discount keeps `code`, `value`, `value_type` (promotion FKs nullify on delete); a tax line keeps `rate`, `label`, `provider_id`, jurisdiction; a duty fee keeps its HS code / origin / rate in `metadata`. Never re-derive a placed order's money from today's catalog.
- Fees are taxable by default (tax lines point at `fee_id`); `duty` fees are excluded from the taxable set.
- Credits are never negative fees — create a discount.

## `Spree::Carts::RecalculateTotals` — the single seam

Everything that changes money ends in this workflow (`Spree.cart_recalculate_totals_workflow`; order twin `Spree.order_recalculate_totals_workflow` = `Spree::Orders::RecalculateTotals`). `cart.recalculate_totals!` is the shortcut.

```
reset caches → total_quantity → item_total / delivery_total / payment_total
  → [unless money-frozen] regenerate rows:
       Spree.adjusters.each { |a| a.adjust(cart) }          # promotions, your fees/discounts
       run_hooks :set_tax_line_context                      # carts.recalculate_totals.set_tax_line_context
       cart.tax_provider.estimate(cart, **cart.tax_estimate_inputs, context:)
  → fold rows into per-line and purchase columns → total → one update_columns
```

Two-pass by design: adjusters persist the discounted base first, then tax is estimated on it.

**What triggers it — writes, not steps.** Item add/upsert/remove (via `Spree::Carts::Recalculate`, which also rebuilds delivery proposals and re-activates promotions), address or market change (`recalculate_for_address_change!` also re-prices items), delivery-rate selection, coupon/gift card/store credit apply/remove, payments, cart merge, and **once more inside the completion lock** — the charged total is never trusted from an earlier request. Reading a cart doesn't recalculate (except the Store API `GET` backfilling missing delivery proposals).

Every Store API write returns the full cart with fresh totals; storefronts never call a "recalculate" endpoint.

### The promotion adjuster is winner-only

`Spree::Adjusters::Promotion` evaluates every eligible promotion on every recalculation and **persists only the winner per competition group**: line-level actions compete per line item, fulfillment actions per fulfillment, order-level actions order-wide (winner distributed across lines). Most negative amount wins; ties go to the newest action. Losing candidates simply aren't written, so they "reinstate" automatically when they become best. It also deletes any `kind: 'promotion'` row it didn't write this pass. Details: `spree-promotions`.

## Money freeze after placement

For a **placed** order (`completed?`) — or when called with `resum_only: true` (seller-split child drafts) — the workflow **skips row regeneration**: no adjusters, no promotion competition, no tax estimation. It only re-sums the rows the order already has. Consequences:

- Today's promotions and tax rates never rewrite last week's order.
- Custom adjusters don't run on placed orders.
- Post-placement money changes go through explicit services that write rows, then re-sum:

| Change | Service | Admin API |
|---|---|---|
| Manual discount (flat/percent, one line or distributed) | `Spree::Orders::Discounts::Create/Update/Destroy` | `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v3/admin/orders/:id/discounts` |
| Fee | `Spree::Orders::Fees::Create/Update/Destroy` | `/api/v3/admin/orders/:id/fees` |
| Tax lines | — (provider-written) | `GET /api/v3/admin/orders/:id/tax_lines` (read-only) |

```ruby
Spree::Orders::Discounts::Create.call(order: order, label: 'Price match', value: '15', value_type: 'flat')
Spree::Orders::Fees::Create.call(order: order, attributes: { label: 'Handling', kind: 'handling', amount: 2.5 })
```

Only `manual` discounts are editable — touching a `promotion` row fails (`422` via the API). Because tax is not re-estimated on a placed order, a manual discount does **not** reduce already-charged tax; handle tax corrections through your tax provider / a return.

## Custom fees and discounts: adjusters

An adjuster owns a family of rows and is re-run on every (unfrozen) recalculation. Contract: subclass `Spree::Adjusters::Base`, implement idempotent `update` (write the rows that should exist, delete the ones that shouldn't). `order` is the cart (or draft order); `order.fees` / `order.discounts` attach to the right owner automatically.

```ruby
# server/app/models/my_app/adjusters/gift_wrap.rb
module MyApp
  module Adjusters
    class GiftWrap < Spree::Adjusters::Base
      PRICE = BigDecimal('4.99')

      def update
        wrapped = order.line_items.select { |li| li.metadata['gift_wrap'].present? }

        order.fees.where(kind: 'gift_wrap').where.not(line_item_id: wrapped.map(&:id)).delete_all
        wrapped.each do |li|
          order.fees.find_or_initialize_by(kind: 'gift_wrap', line_item_id: li.id)
               .update!(label: 'Gift wrapping', amount: PRICE * li.quantity)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# server/config/initializers/spree.rb — MUST be after_initialize:
# core assigns Spree.adjusters = [Spree::Adjusters::Promotion] in its own after_initialize,
# which would wipe anything appended earlier.
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Spree.adjusters << MyApp::Adjusters::GiftWrap
  Spree::Fee::KINDS << 'insurance' unless Spree::Fee::KINDS.include?('insurance') # custom fee kind (validated, not frozen)
end
```

Custom **discounts** from an adjuster must use `kind: 'manual'` (`Spree::Discount::KINDS` is frozen to `promotion`/`manual`) and attach to a line item or fulfillment. Don't write `kind: 'promotion'` rows — the promotion adjuster deletes rows it didn't create.

Fees written by an adjuster are taxed in the same pass (the provider runs after adjusters).

## Duties

A customs duty is a `Spree::Fee` with `kind: 'duty'`, written by a landed-cost integration (typically an adjuster). Rules:

- Not in the default taxable set (`purchase.taxable_items` excludes duties) — import VAT, if any, is written by the duty provider itself as a tax line against the duty fee.
- Snapshot the inputs (HS code, origin, rate) in the fee's `metadata`; never recompute a placed order's duty.
- Variants carry `hs_code`, `country_of_origin` (manufacture, not ship-from), `customs_description`.

## Rendering totals (Store API / SDK)

Money is a **string** (`"135.60"`) plus a pre-formatted `display_*` twin (`"$135.60"`). Render `display_*`; if you must do math, use a decimal library or integer cents — never JS floats.

```typescript
cart.display_item_total      // items
cart.display_discount_total  // negative
cart.display_delivery_total
cart.display_fee_total       // cart.fees[] for line-by-line (label, kind, display_amount)
cart.display_tax_total       // safe single tax line (included + additional)
cart.display_total
cart.display_amount_due      // after gift cards / store credit
```

- Building your own subtotal? Add **`additional_tax_total` only** — never `included_tax_total` (it's inside the prices already). The #1 European-storefront bug.
- List fees between subtotal and total; they're already in `total`, don't add them again. Show `duty` fees under their own label.
- Store API `cart.discounts` / `order.discounts` is a **per-applied-promotion summary** (`name`, `code`, `amount`, `display_amount`, `promotion_id`), not the typed `Spree::Discount` rows; typed rows are on the Admin API (`adminClient.orders.discounts`).
- Gift cards and store credit are payments, not discounts — they reduce `amount_due`, not `total`.
- With hidden prices (gated B2B guests) money attributes serialize as `null`.

## Gotchas

- **`discount_total` counts only `promotion` rows.** Manual discounts (and custom adjuster discounts) are in `adjustment_total` and `total` but not in `discount_total`. If your summary shows `discount_total` + `total`, a manual discount looks like a missing amount — show `item_total + delivery_total + fee_total + additional_tax_total − total` as "Discounts", or list `Spree::Discount` rows.
- **Never write totals columns directly** (`update_column(:total, …)`) — the next recalculation overwrites them. Write rows, then call `recalculate_totals!` / the order services.
- **Never create `TaxLine` rows by hand.** They're replace-all per item by the provider; yours vanish on the next estimate.
- **Changing items unapplies gift cards and checkout store credit** (`Spree::Carts::Recalculate`) — re-apply after edits.
- An adjuster that raises aborts the whole recalculation (and the customer's add-to-cart). Keep external calls out of adjusters or rescue inside.
- Don't read `row.order` during checkout — use `row.owner`.
