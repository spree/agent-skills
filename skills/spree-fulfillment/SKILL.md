# Spree Fulfillment

A **fulfillment** (`Spree::Fulfillment`, prefix `ful_`, number `F…`) is one batch of items going to the customer by one delivery method from one stock location — a parcel, a download, or an order waiting at a pickup counter. A cart/order gets one fulfillment per (stock location × delivery profile × splitter output); the customer picks a delivery rate per fulfillment.

Coming from 5.x (`Shipment`, `ShippingMethod`, `StockItem`, shipment state machine)? Constant aliases exist until 6.1, but see **spree-upgrade-5-to-6** — don't write new code against the old names.

## The model graph

```

        ├── FulfillmentItem (fi_) × n     line_item + variant + quantity; status on_hand/backordered/shipped/returned
        ├── DeliveryRate (dr_) × n        the options offered; one has selected: true
        │     └── DeliveryMethod (dm_)    what the customer picks ("Standard", "Express", "Collect in store")
        ├── Delivery (dlv_) × n           each consignment/parcel: tracking_number, carrier, status

```

Things to internalize:

- **Every fulfillment has exactly one owner** — `cart_id` during checkout, `order_id` after placement. Read `fulfillment.owner`, never assume `.order`.
- **Delivery type comes from the method's fulfillment provider class**, not a string column: `delivery_method.digital?`, `.pickup?`, `.pickup_point?`, `.requires_address?`. The API exposes `fulfillment_type` (`shipping | digital | pickup | pickup_point`) on the fulfillment.
- **The delivery profile decides what a product can use.** A digital profile only accepts digital providers; a shipping profile accepts everything else. Origin groups narrow which locations may source the product — the coordinator never packs a product from a location its profile doesn't cover.
- `cart.delivery_step_required?` is `line_items.any? && !digital?` — an all-digital cart skips delivery. `shipping_address_required?` asks the selected methods (or the profiles, before a method is chosen) — a shipping profile offering only pickup needs no address.
- **Delivery zones are delivery-only.** Tax zones are separate (spree-taxes).

## Statuses

`Spree::Fulfillment` uses `has_status :unfulfilled, :fulfilled, :delivered, :canceled` — a string `status` column, no state machine. Statuses describe what *the merchant* did with the parcel and only move forward:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `unfulfilled` | Still with you |
| `fulfilled` | Handed over (carrier, pickup counter, or download made available); `fulfilled_at` set |
| `delivered` | Customer has it; `delivered_at` set (from the carrier's scan, not webhook arrival) |
| `canceled` | Won't be sent. Final — there is no resume |

Payment/backorder readiness is **not** a status. It is checked by `Spree::Fulfillments::Fulfill` at the moment you ship, and returns a reason (`order_not_paid`, `backordered_units`, `insufficient_stock_on_hand`, `order_draft`). Staff pass `force: true` to ship against an unpaid invoice or past a backorder (never past a draft order). `can_fulfill?` / `can_cancel?` are phrased negatively ("not already gone out"), so custom pre-handover statuses stay fulfillable.

Carrier truth lives on each **`Spree::Delivery`** (`Spree::Delivery::STATUSES`: `pending pre_transit in_transit out_for_delivery available_for_pickup delivered return_to_sender failure unknown`) and never moves the fulfillment backwards. The fulfillment becomes `delivered` when every consignment has arrived. `tracking` / `tracking_url` on the fulfillment summarize the first delivery.

The order rolls this up into `order.fulfillment_status` (written only by `Spree::Orders::UpdateStatuses`): `unfulfilled`, `partial`, `fulfilled`, `delivered`, `backorder`, `canceled`. Don't write it yourself.

## Transitions are workflows

Never `update!(status: 'fulfilled')`. Call the workflow through its DI key so apps can swap it:

| Action | Workflow (`Spree.<key>`) | Hooks |
|---|---|---|
| Ship (whole or partial) | `fulfillment_fulfill_workflow` → `Spree::Fulfillments::Fulfill` | `validate`, `after_fulfill` |
| Confirm receipt | `fulfillment_mark_delivered_workflow` → `Fulfillments::MarkDelivered` | `validate`, `after_mark_delivered` |
| Cancel | `fulfillment_cancel_workflow` → `Fulfillments::Cancel` | `validate`, `after_cancel` |
| Manual/3PL fulfillment on a placed order | `fulfillment_create_workflow` → `Fulfillments::Create` | `validate`, `get_provider_data`, `after_create` |
| Edit (tracking, rate, location) | `fulfillment_update_workflow` → `Fulfillments::Update` | |
| Buy a label ahead of dispatch | `fulfillment_purchase_label_workflow` → `Fulfillments::PurchaseLabel` | |
| Carrier tracking update | `delivery_update_tracking_workflow` → `Deliveries::UpdateTracking` | `validate`, `after_update_tracking` |

```ruby
result = Spree.fulfillment_fulfill_workflow.call(
  fulfillment: fulfillment,
  items: [{ line_item: line_item, quantity: 1 }], # omit to ship everything
  tracking: '1Z999AA10123456784',                # becomes the primary Spree::Delivery
  notify_customer: true,
  force: false
)
result.value # the fulfillment that actually shipped — for a partial ship, the NEW split-off one
```

What `Fulfill` does, in order: `validate` hook → guards → split off requested units (via `Fulfillments::Create`, cost 0) → record tracking → buy a label if the provider `generates_labels?` and none is active (failure is reported, parcel still ships) → `provider.create_fulfillment` → unstock allocated units (`shipped` movements) → mark items `shipped` + fulfillment `fulfilled` + publish `fulfillment.fulfilled` → capture payments whose method charges on dispatch → roll up order statuses.

**Manual fulfillments** (mirroring a 3PL or courier back into Spree): `POST /api/v3/admin/orders/:order_id/fulfillments` with `stock_location_id`, `items: [{ item_id: 'li_…', quantity }]`, optional `tracking`, `delivery_method_id`, `cost`, `status`, `metadata`. Units move out of their current fulfillments (restock/unstock when locations differ); emptied sources are destroyed and their cost carries over. Quirk: the only accepted `status` value is the legacy `'shipped'` (registers it already fulfilled); anything else fails `invalid_status`.

**Splitting without shipping**: `PATCH …/fulfillments/:id/split` takes `variant_id`, `quantity`, optional `stock_location_id` (moves units to a new fulfillment, possibly at another location) and returns every fulfillment on the order.

## Gating and custom stages

Gate handover with a validate hook — handlers receive the workflow and call `reject!`:

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree.rb
Spree.hooks.register('fulfillments.fulfill.validate') do |flow|
  work_order = MyApp::WorkOrder.find_by(fulfillment_id: flow.fulfillment.id)
  flow.reject!('Still in production') unless work_order&.completed?
end
```

Hook keys are `<workflow key>.<hook>` where the workflow key is the class name minus `Spree::`, underscored and dotted (`Spree::Fulfillments::Fulfill` → `fulfillments.fulfill`). Unknown keys fail boot when eager loading.

Add a real status only when staff filter by it, reports group by it, or webhooks should fire on it:

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree.rb — to_prepare so it survives dev reloads
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Spree::Fulfillment.add_status('in_production', after: 'unfulfilled')
end
```

That gives `in_production?`, `.in_production` and a valid value. Moving into it is your own `Spree::Workflow` (see spree-workflows); core fulfill/cancel keep working on it. Statuses are additive only — never remove a core one.

## Rates: calculators vs rate providers

Every `DeliveryMethod` has a `rate_provider` (class name string, validated against `Spree.delivery_rate_providers`) and a calculator:

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Arithmetic on what's in the parcel (flat, per item, % of item total, price sack, flexi, free for digital) | A **calculator** — built-ins under `Spree::Calculator::Shipping::*` |
| A price that comes from outside Spree (carrier API, aggregator, contract rate card service) | A **rate provider** — `Spree::DeliveryRateProvider::Base` subclass |
| "Quoted after review" (pallets, containers) | `Spree::DeliveryRateProvider::Freight` — returns an `unpriced` rate carrying the freight summary |
| "Only offer this when …" (order value, weight, volume, company buyer, channel, excluded products) | A **DeliveryMethodRule** on the method, not calculator thresholds (the calculator `minimum_*`/`maximum_*` preferences are deprecated) |

Default provider is `Spree::DeliveryRateProvider::Internal` (prices via the calculator). Amount-based calculators carry a `currency` preference — a calculator whose currency doesn't match the order contributes nothing (no conversion). Create one method or calculator per currency you sell in. Rate-provider estimates in another currency are dropped by `Spree::Stock::Estimator` for the same reason.

Custom calculator:

```ruby
class MyApp::Calculator::DimensionalWeight < Spree::ShippingCalculator
  preference :rate_per_kg, :decimal, default: 0
  preference :currency, :string, default: -> { Spree::Store.default&.default_currency }

  def self.description = 'Dimensional weight'

  def supports_currency?(currency) = currency.casecmp?(preferred_currency)

  def compute_package(package)
    package.weight * preferred_rate_per_kg # nil hides the method
  end
end

# config/initializers/spree.rb — core ASSIGNS this list in after_initialize, so append there
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Spree.calculators.shipping_methods << MyApp::Calculator::DimensionalWeight
end
```

Custom carrier rate provider (full contract, service catalog and testing in `references/provider-contracts.md`):

```ruby
module SpreeAcme
  class DeliveryRateProvider < Spree::DeliveryRateProvider::Base
    def self.integration_class = 'SpreeAcme::Integration' # hidden/refused until connected
    def self.requires_address? = true                        # it quotes real shipments

    def estimates(package)
      integration.client.rates(from: package.stock_location, to: package.order.ship_address, weight: package.weight).map do |q|
        Spree::DeliveryRateProvider::Estimate.new(
          cost: q.amount, currency: q.currency, carrier: q.carrier,
          service_level: q.service, estimated_delivery_date: q.eta, metadata: { quote_id: q.id }
        )
      end
    rescue SpreeAcme::Error => e
      Rails.error.report(e, source: 'acme.rating')
      [] # never raise into checkout — an empty array hides the method
    end
  end
end

Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Spree.integrations << 'SpreeAcme::Integration'
  Spree.delivery_rate_providers << SpreeAcme::DeliveryRateProvider
end
```

`cost` is pre-tax; Spree applies tax afterwards. The reference implementation is the `spree_easypost` gem (`SpreeEasyPost::DeliveryRateProvider` + `SpreeEasyPost::FulfillmentProvider` + `SpreeEasyPost::Integration`).

## Fulfillment providers (dispatch, labels, 3PL/WMS)

`delivery_method.fulfillment_provider` (default `Spree::FulfillmentProvider::Manual`; also `Digital`, `Pickup`, `PickupPoint`) owns the outbound mechanics. A WMS/3PL/carrier integration subclasses `Spree::FulfillmentProvider::Base` and implements `create_fulfillment(fulfillment)` (return `{ tracking_number:, tracking_url: }` optionally) and `cancel_fulfillment(fulfillment)`; label-generating carriers also override `self.generates_labels?`, `purchase_label(owner)` (owner is a `Fulfillment` or a `Return`), `refund_label(label)`, and optionally `tracking_url(delivery)`, `documents(owner)`, `can_fulfill?(fulfillment)`. Register in `after_initialize`: `Spree.fulfillment_providers << MyProvider` (core assigns that list too).

**Carrier tracking webhook**: Spree owns `POST /api/v3/webhooks/fulfillments/:integration_id` (prefixed integration ID, no API key). The integration is looked up by ID alone and the request runs in the integration's own store (`Spree::Current.store = integration.store`), so one URL per integration works for every store. Your `Spree::Integration` subclass implements `parse_webhook_event(raw_post, headers)`: verify the signature (raise `Spree::Integration::WebhookSignatureError` → 401, also when no secret is configured), return `{ tracking_code:, tracking_status:, estimated_delivery_at:, delivered_at:, details: }` or `nil` to ignore (→ 200). The controller finds the `Spree::Delivery` in the integration's store by tracking number and runs `Deliveries::UpdateTracking`; a `delivered` status confirms receipt on the fulfillment. Map unknown carrier statuses to `'unknown'`.

## Order routing and stock splitters

Two layers decide how items become fulfillments:

1. **Which stock locations** — order routing. `Spree::OrderRouting::Strategy::Rules` (default) walks the channel's `Spree::OrderRoutingRule` rows (`PreferredLocation`, `MinimizeSplits`, `DefaultLocation`; lower rank wins, `nil` abstains). Custom rule: subclass `Spree::OrderRoutingRule`, implement `rank(order, locations)` returning one `LocationRanking` per location, register via `Spree.order_routing.rules << MyRule`, create a row per channel. Custom strategy: subclass `Spree::OrderRouting::Strategy::Base`, implement `for_allocation` (returns `Spree::Stock::Package`s) plus `for_sale(fulfillment:)`, `for_release`, `for_cancellation`; register via `Spree.order_routing.strategies << MyStrategy`, select with `store.preferred_order_routing_strategy` / `channel.preferred_order_routing_strategy` (unregistered values fall back to Rules).
2. **How one location's allocation is broken into packages** — splitters. Default chain `Spree.stock_splitters = [Splitter::DeliveryProfile, Splitter::Backordered]`; `Splitter::Weight` (class-level `threshold`, default 150) is opt-in. Custom: subclass `Spree::Stock::Splitter::Base`, implement `split(packages)` and always end with `return_next(packages)`.

**Know where routing actually applies.** Storefront checkout builds fulfillments with `Cart#rebuild_fulfillments!`, which calls `Spree::Stock::Coordinator` directly — it respects delivery-profile origin groups, the channel's served locations and the splitter chain, but **does not consult the routing strategy or routing rules**. `Carts::Complete` copies the cart's fulfillments onto the order. The routing strategy runs in `Order#rebuild_fulfillments!` — admin draft-order create/update (`Spree::Orders::BuildFulfillments`, a no-op once the order is placed) and `OrderInventory` changes on placed orders. Editing a placed order's items never rebuilds its fulfillments — `Spree::OrderInventory` adjusts them in place, so the allocations made at placement stay on rows that cancel/ship can still release. The strategy's `for_sale`/`for_release`/`for_cancellation` are part of the contract but core does not call them today (Rules implements them as no-ops) — do post-allocation side effects in fulfillment workflow hooks or `fulfillment.*` subscribers instead. Claim/exchange replacements also use the Coordinator. To change which warehouse storefront carts ship from, use delivery profiles/origin groups, channel stock locations, or a decorator on the Coordinator — not a routing rule alone.

```ruby
# Splitters are assigned by core in after_initialize — append there, not in to_prepare
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Spree.stock_splitters << MyApp::Stock::Splitter::Refrigerated
end
```

## Pickup, digital, freight

- **Pickup**: methods with `FulfillmentProvider::Pickup` serve pickup-enabled stock locations (`GET /api/v3/store/delivery_methods/:id/pickup_locations`); `PickupPoint` asks a pickup point provider (`…/pickup_points?latitude=&longitude=`). Pickup orders are closed out with mark-delivered.
- **Digital**: assign the product the store's digital delivery profile. The `Digital` fulfillment provider auto-fulfills on placement and grants `Spree::DigitalLink`s (event `digital_link.downloaded`). Deliver something other than an uploaded file via a `Spree::DigitalAssetProvider::Base` subclass (`deliver(digital_link, expires_in:)`), registered in `Spree.digital_asset_providers`.
- **Freight**: methods on the `Freight` rate provider bounded by `volume_rule` / `company_rule`; rates come back `unpriced: true`, display "Quoted after review", sort after priced rates, and checkout still completes.

## API surface

- Store: `PATCH /api/v3/store/carts/:cart_id/fulfillments/:id` with `selected_delivery_rate_id`; rates are on `cart.fulfillments[].delivery_rates`.
- Admin — permission keys: `read_/write_fulfillments` for the fulfillments endpoints (nested labels/deliveries sit under `*_orders`), `*_delivery_methods` for methods/rules, `*_package_types`, `*_settings` for zones and profiles. Endpoints: `…/orders/:order_id/fulfillments` (index/show/create/update) + member `fulfill` (`items: [{ item_id, quantity }]`, `tracking`, `tracking_carrier`, `notify_customer`, `force`), `mark_delivered`, `cancel`, `split`; nested `labels` (create/destroy, `download`, `refund`) and `deliveries` (CRUD, `mark_delivered`). Setup: `delivery_methods` (+ `calculators`, `rate_providers`, `fulfillment_providers`, nested `rules`), `delivery_method_rules/types`, `delivery_zones`, `delivery_profiles` (+ `kinds`, nested `origin_groups`), `package_types`, `tracking_carriers`.
- Admin SDK: `adminClient.orders.fulfillments.{list,fulfill,markDelivered,cancel,split}`, `.labels.*`, `.deliveries.*`.

## Events

`fulfillment.created/updated/deleted`, `fulfillment.fulfilled` (metadata `notify_customer`), `fulfillment.delivered`, `fulfillment.canceled`; `delivery.created/updated/deleted`; `shipping_label.purchased/.refunded` (+ lifecycle); order-level `order.fulfilled`, `order.delivered`. There is no `fulfillment.resumed`. Use subscribers for WMS sync and emails (spree-events-webhooks).

## Troubleshooting

**No delivery rates at checkout** (cart shows a `delivery_unavailable` warning, fulfillment pruned):
- The product's delivery profile has no method whose zone (or origin group) covers the address / source location.
- A `DeliveryMethodRule` excludes the package (item total, weight, volume, company, channel).
- Calculator currency ≠ cart currency, or the calculator returned `nil`.
- The rate provider's integration isn't connected, it raised (check error reports), or it returned only foreign-currency estimates.
- Console: `Spree::Stock::Coordinator.new(cart).packages.map { |p| [p.stock_location.name, p.delivery_rates.map(&:name)] }`, or `Spree::Stock::Estimator.new(cart).delivery_rates(package, Spree::DeliveryMethod::BACKOFFICE)` to include admin-only methods.

**Fulfill returns 422**: read the error — unpaid (`force` or capture first), backordered units, not enough `count_on_hand` at the location (correct stock, or `force`), draft order, or your own `validate` hook.

**Ships from the wrong warehouse**: storefront carts ignore routing rules (see above) — check the product's delivery profile origin groups, the channel's stock locations, and `StockLevel` presence at each location.

**Tracking webhook does nothing**: the endpoint answers 200 for unknown tracking codes and `nil` events by design; 401 means signature verification failed; the integration must be active in the current store.

## Testing

Factories (spree_dev_tools / `spree/testing_support`): `:fulfillment`, `:fulfillment_item`, `:delivery_method`, `:free_delivery_method`, `:digital_delivery_method`, `:pickup_delivery_method`, `:delivery_zone`, `:delivery_zone_with_country`, `:delivery_profile`, `:digital_delivery_profile`, `:delivery_rate`, `:delivery`, `:stock_package`, `:cart_ready_for_delivery`, `:completed_order_with_totals`. Stub carrier clients — rate quoting runs on every checkout. Set `Spree::Current.store` in specs that build rates outside a request.
