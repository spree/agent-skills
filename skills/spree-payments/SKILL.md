# Spree Payments

```
PaymentMethod (pm_, belongs_to :store)       — a configured way to pay (STI: SpreeStripe::Gateway, Spree::PaymentMethod::Check, …)
  ├── PaymentSession (ps_)                     — gateway-side session (e.g. Stripe PaymentIntent); owned by a cart or order
  ├── PaymentSetupSession (pss_)               — save a payment method for later (e.g. SetupIntent); belongs to a customer
  └── GatewayCustomer                          — provider customer id per customer (internal, encrypted at rest)
Payment (py_)  — one attempt against a cart/order (cart_id + order_id; #owner)
  ├── source: CreditCard (card_) | PaymentSource (wallets, BNPL, bank) | StoreCredit (credit_)
  └── Refund (re_) × n  — with a RefundReason (rr_)
```

A payment is linked to its session by `payment.response_code == payment_session.external_id`. A cart can carry several payments (e.g. store credit + card).

## Payment statuses (no state machine)

`status` is a plain string (`Spree::HasStatus`) written only by the payment workflows and `Spree::Payment::Processing`:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `checkout` | Created, not yet processed (default) |
| `processing` | Claimed for a gateway call (atomic claim; blocks double submission) |
| `pending` | Authorized, not captured |
| `completed` | Captured — only these count toward what's paid |
| `failed` | Gateway rejected it (retryable on the same row) |
| `void` | Voided |
| `invalid` | Superseded by a newer checkout payment (`has_invalid_status?` — `invalid?` is ActiveModel's) |

The order's `payment_status` (`none`, `authorized`, `partially_paid`, `paid`, `partially_refunded`, `refunded`, `overcharged`, `voided`) is derived by `Spree::Orders::UpdateStatuses` from payments and refunds — never assign it. "Refunded" counts both ledgers: `Spree::Refund` rows **and** store credit issued as a refund (`order.store_credit_refunds`, `StoreCredit#refunded_order_id`), so an order refunded to store credit reads `partially_refunded` / `refunded`, not `paid`. `Spree::Order.refunded` / `.partially_refunded` scopes filter on this status.

## Capture timing

`capture_method` is a store preference (`preferred_capture_method`, default `checkout`) that a payment method can override (`capture_method`, nil = inherit):

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `checkout` | Charged when the order is placed → `completed` |
| `on_dispatch` | Authorized at checkout (`pending`), captured when goods are dispatched |
| `manual` | Authorized at checkout (`pending`); staff capture when they choose |

```typescript
await admin.store.update({ preferred_capture_method: 'on_dispatch' })
await admin.paymentMethods.update('pm_xxx', { capture_method: 'manual' })  // null → inherit store
await admin.orders.payments.capture('or_xxx', 'py_xxx')
await admin.orders.payments.void('or_xxx', 'py_xxx')
```

In Ruby: `payment_method.resolved_capture_method`, `Spree.payment_capture_workflow.call(payment:, amount: nil)` — **`amount` is in cents**; a smaller amount captures part and splits the remainder into a new pending payment. `Spree.payment_void_workflow.call(payment:)`.

## Payment methods

| Attribute | Notes |
|---|---|
| `type` | API sends the shorthand (`stripe`, `check`, `store_credit`, …); the column holds the class |
| `store` | Single owner — `current_store.payment_methods` |
| `active` | Inactive methods are hidden everywhere |
| `storefront_visible` | `false` = staff-only (e.g. "Invoice" for admin-created orders). Replaces `display_on`. The Store API payment and payment-session endpoints accept only `active.storefront_visible` methods — a staff-only method's ID is a 404 there, not a loophole |
| `capture_method` | Override, see above |
| `preferences` | Gateway credentials — YAML in a plain text column, **not encrypted**; treat DB dumps as secret |

Hooks to override on a subclass: `session_required?`, `setup_session_supported?`, `source_required?`, `available_for_order?(order)`, `available_for_store?(store)`, `payment_icon_name`. The Store API embeds `payment_methods` (with `session_required`) in the cart response.

### Installing a gateway

```bash
spree bundle add spree_stripe && spree generate spree_stripe:install
spree bundle add spree_adyen --github spree/spree_adyen && spree generate spree_adyen:install
spree bundle add spree_paypal_checkout && spree generate spree_paypal_checkout:install
spree bundle add spree_razorpay_checkout && spree generate spree_razorpay_checkout:install
spree restart
```

Classic Rails app: `bundle add … && bin/rails g …:install`. Then create the payment method in the dashboard (Settings → Payments) and register its webhook URL (`payment_method.webhook_url` → `/api/v3/webhooks/payments/pm_…`) with the provider. `spree_stripe` is the reference implementation (sessions, setup sessions, webhooks, wallets, Stripe Connect payouts).

## Two flows

### Session-based (Stripe, Adyen, PayPal…) — `session_required? == true`

```typescript
const opts = { spreeToken: cart.token }
// 1. After delivery is chosen (amount must include shipping); recreate/update if the total changes
const session = await client.carts.paymentSessions.create(cart.id, { payment_method_id: 'pm_xxx' }, opts)
// 2. Customer pays in the provider SDK with session.external_data.client_secret (3DS/redirects handled there)
// 3. Confirm — creates/settles the Payment, does NOT place the order
await client.carts.paymentSessions.complete(cart.id, session.id, { session_result: '…' }, opts)
// 4. Place the order (Order | OrderGroup on a multi-seller marketplace cart — narrow with isOrderGroup)
const result = await client.carts.complete(cart.id, opts)
```

Session statuses: `pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`, `expired` (no cancel endpoint — cancel/expire come from the provider or `expires_at`).

**Webhook-first completion.** The provider's webhook (`POST /api/v3/webhooks/payments/:payment_method_id`) is the authoritative signal: Spree finds the payment method by its prefixed ID alone (providers send no API key or store header), sets `Spree::Current.store` to the payment method's store, verifies the signature against that method's own secret synchronously (401 on failure), enqueues `Spree::Payments::HandleWebhookJob`, returns 200, then settles the payment and completes the cart via `Carts::Complete` — the job also runs in the payment method's store, so a non-default store's webhooks work without any host/header routing. Whichever of browser or webhook arrives first wins; the other is a no-op. Never treat a redirect back from the provider as proof of payment.

### Direct (Check, cash on delivery, bank transfer, PO) — `session_required? == false`

```typescript
await client.carts.payments.create(cart.id, {
  payment_method_id: 'pm_check',
  metadata: { purchase_order_number: 'PO-12345' },   // optional; amount defaults to total minus store credit
}, opts)
await client.carts.complete(cart.id, opts)
```

422 codes: `payment_session_required` (method needs a session), `payment_method_unavailable` (the method's `available_for_order?(cart)` is false — also checked when creating a payment session). On completion the payment lands `pending` (or `completed` when capture is `checkout`); staff capture it when the money arrives.

### Saved payment methods

`client.customer.paymentSetupSessions.create({ payment_method_id }, { token: jwt })` → confirm with the provider SDK using `external_client_secret` → `.complete(id, { external_data: {} })` creates a `CreditCard`/`PaymentSource`. Requires a signed-in customer.

## Building a custom payment method

```ruby
# app/models/my_gateway.rb
class MyGateway < Spree::PaymentMethod
  preference :api_key, :string
  preference :webhook_secret, :string

  def session_required? = true
  def source_required? = false
  def payment_session_class = Spree::PaymentSessions::MyGateway   # STI < Spree::PaymentSession

  # `order:` receives the Cart during checkout
  def create_payment_session(order:, amount: nil, external_data: {})
    total = amount.presence || order.total_minus_store_credits
    remote = client.create_session(amount_cents: Spree::Money.new(total, currency: order.currency).cents,
                                   currency: order.currency, reference: order.prefixed_id)
    payment_session_class.create!(owner: order, payment_method: self, amount: total, currency: order.currency,
                                  status: 'pending', external_id: remote.id, customer: order.customer,
                                  external_data: { client_secret: remote.client_secret })
  end

  def update_payment_session(payment_session:, amount: nil, external_data: {})
    client.update_session(payment_session.external_id, amount: amount) if amount.present?
    payment_session.update!(amount: amount) if amount.present?
    payment_session
  end

  # Verify with the provider, settle the Payment, move the session. Must NOT complete the order.
  def complete_payment_session(payment_session:, params: {})
    remote = client.retrieve_session(payment_session.external_id)
    case remote.status
    when 'succeeded', 'authorized'
      payment_session.process if payment_session.can_process?
      payment_session.settle_payment!(captured: remote.status == 'succeeded')  # false → payment stays pending
      payment_session.complete unless payment_session.completed?
    else
      payment_session.fail if payment_session.can_fail?
    end
    payment_session
  end

  # Return { action: :captured|:authorized|:failed|:canceled, payment_session:, metadata: {} } or nil to ignore
  def parse_webhook_event(raw_body, headers)
    raise Spree::PaymentMethod::WebhookSignatureError unless client.valid_signature?(raw_body, headers['HTTP_X_SIGNATURE'], preferred_webhook_secret)

    event = JSON.parse(raw_body)
    session = payment_sessions.find_by(external_id: event.dig('data', 'session_id'))
    return unless session

    { 'payment.succeeded' => { action: :captured, payment_session: session },
      'payment.failed'    => { action: :failed,   payment_session: session } }[event['type']]
  end

  def payment_icon_name = 'my-gateway'

  private

  def client = MyProvider::Client.new(preferred_api_key)
end
```

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree.rb — core reassigns this registry in its own after_initialize,
# so register inside after_initialize or the entry is wiped
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Spree.payment_methods << MyGateway
end
```

- `settle_payment!(captured:)` is the single settlement path shared by the confirm call and the webhook — it locks the owner, finds or creates the payment, and confirms it; it's safe to race.
- Session transitions (`process`, `complete`, `fail`, `cancel`, `expire`) are non-raising compare-and-swap writes returning `false` when they lose a race; guards are `can_process?`, `can_complete?`, `can_fail?`…
- For setup sessions: `setup_session_supported?`, `payment_setup_session_class`, `create_payment_setup_session(customer:, external_data:)`, `complete_payment_setup_session(setup_session:, params:)`.
- Legacy card gateways subclass `Spree::Gateway` (ActiveMerchant-style `authorize`/`purchase`/`capture`/`void`/`credit` on a provider).

Extend behaviour without subclassing via workflow hooks: `payments.process.validate`, `payments.capture.before_capture`, `payments.void.after_void`, `payment_sessions.complete.after_complete`, `payments.handle_webhook.after_handle` (`Spree.hooks.register('payments.capture.validate', ->(wf) { wf.reject!('…') if … })`). See `spree-workflows`.

## Refunds

Refunds are Admin-only (no Store API route) and run through `Spree::Refunds::Create` (`Spree.refund_create_workflow`): the refund row commits first, then the gateway is credited; a clean gateway failure removes the uncredited row.

```typescript
await admin.orders.refunds.create('or_xxx', { payment_id: 'py_xxx', amount: '25.00', refund_reason_id: 'rr_xxx' })
```

The param is `refund_reason_id` (older `@spree/admin-sdk` releases also accepted `reason_id`, which the API silently drops — the refund then falls back to the store's first refund reason).

```ruby
Spree.refund_create_workflow.call(payment: payment, amount: 25, reason: reason, refunder: admin_user)
# amount nil → full creditable balance (payment.credit_allowed)
```

Hooks: `refunds.create.validate`, `.before_refund`, `.after_refund`. Publishes `payment.refunded`; the order moves to `partially_refunded` / `refunded`. Returns-driven refunds (to the original payment or store credit) go through `Spree::Returns::Refund` — see `spree-returns`.

## Store credits and gift cards

| | Store credit (`credit_`) | Gift card (`gc_`) |
|---|---|---|
| Belongs to | A customer (and store) | A store; optional customer |
| Issued by | Admin (`admin.customers.storeCredits.create('cust_xxx', { amount, currency, memo })`) or return/exchange workflows (`originator`) | Admin (`admin.giftCards.create`, bulk via `admin.giftCardBatches.create`) |
| At checkout | `client.carts.storeCredits.apply(cartId, amount?)` / `.remove` — signed-in customers | `client.carts.giftCards.apply(cartId, code)` / `.remove` — guests too; separate from `discount_codes` |
| Expiry | Never; spent oldest-first (`Spree::StoreCredit.oldest_first`) | Per card `expires_at` |
| Statuses | — | `active`, `partially_redeemed`, `redeemed`, `canceled` (+ expired by date) |

Both pay via `Spree::PaymentMethod::StoreCredit` and reduce the amount due, not the order total. Workflows: `Spree.gift_card_apply_workflow` / `gift_card_remove_workflow` / `gift_card_redeem_workflow` / `gift_card_cancel_workflow`; `Spree.store_credit_apply_service` / `store_credit_remove_service`. Cancelling a gift card is refused once it has been spent against. A gift card's `code` is a bearer credential: Admin API responses show it in full only to callers holding `read_gift_cards` (masked to the last four characters elsewhere, e.g. on orders), the webhook delivery log stores it as `[REDACTED]`, and company members see it masked on colleagues' orders. Setting `customer_id` on a gift card through the Admin API needs `read_customers` too (403 `required_permission` otherwise). `Spree::StoreCreditCategory` / `StoreCreditType` are deprecated shells.

## Events

`payment.completed`, `payment.paid`, `payment.captured`, `payment.voided`, `payment.refunded`, `order.paid` (order fully settled — also per child order on split marketplace checkouts), `payment_session.{processing,completed,failed,canceled,expired}`, `payment_setup_session.*`, `gift_card.*`. There is no gateway log table — for transaction forensics use `payment.gateway_dashboard_payment_url` or the `PaymentSession`'s `external_data`. See `spree-events-webhooks`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Payment stuck in `processing`**: the claim happened but the gateway call/crash didn't finish. `failed` and `processing` are claimable, so re-running the workflow (`Spree.payment_process_workflow.call(payment:)`) retries on the same row — check the provider dashboard first.
- **Charged but no order**: the webhook should complete it — verify the webhook URL/secret at the provider and that jobs are running (Solid Queue / `/jobs`). Check `payment_session.status` and `cart.completed_at`.
- **Webhook 401**: `parse_webhook_event` raised `WebhookSignatureError` — wrong secret, or you parsed a re-serialized body instead of `raw_body`.
- **Direct payment rejected with `payment_session_required`**: that method needs the session flow.
- **Amount mismatch on session**: session created before delivery/coupon changed the total — update the session amount or create a new one.
