# Spree Security

Spree inherits Rails' security model and adds an e-commerce attack surface: payment flows, customer PII, staff credentials and outbound webhooks. This skill covers what a developer extending Spree 6 has to get right. For **who may do what** (roles, permission keys, scopes, storefront ownership, SSO), see `spree-auth-permissions`.

## Threat model in four lines

1. **Store API**: internet-facing and called by untrusted clients. Risks: IDOR on carts/orders, XSS via catalog content, abuse of cart/auth endpoints.
2. **Admin API + dashboard**: staff credentials get phished and integrations leak keys. Risks: over-scoped secret keys, cross-store leaks in custom controllers, privilege creep in roles.
3. **Payments**: money and PCI. Risks: card data in logs or the DB, unverified gateway webhooks, refund abuse.
4. **Outbound traffic**: webhooks and integrations. Risks: SSRF, unverified receivers.

## Secrets

- Keep them in Rails encrypted credentials or env vars, never in the repo. `VITE_*` variables are compiled into the dashboard bundle, so **never put a secret in one**.
- **Leaked secret:** rotate at the provider first, then update credentials/env and deploy, then scrub git history (`git filter-repo`). If you clean history first, the leaked key keeps working until it's rotated.
- **`secret_key_base` must stay stable per environment.** Secret API keys are stored as HMAC-SHA256 digests keyed by it, so rotating it invalidates every `sk_` key. It's also the last fallback for JWT signing. Set a dedicated JWT secret with `SPREE_JWT_SECRET_KEY` (or credentials `jwt_secret_key`).
- **Active Record encryption.** Spree encrypts `Spree::WebhookEndpoint#secret_key` and `Spree::GatewayCustomer#profile_id` (deterministic) and `Spree::UserIdentity#access_token` / `#refresh_token` (OAuth tokens) **only when keys are configured** — without them they're plaintext, and the starter logs a warning at boot. Set all three env vars: `ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY`, `ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_DETERMINISTIC_KEY`, `ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_KEY_DERIVATION_SALT`.
  - `create-spree-app` writes a dev set into `.env`; `spree encryption init` adds one to an older project's `.env` (never overwrites existing keys, no `--force`; then recreate containers with `spree update`, or `spree dev` when ejected — `spree restart` keeps the old env); `spree encryption init --print` or `bin/rails db:encryption:init` prints a fresh set for production. Use a separate set per environment and back it up in your secret manager.
  - The starter's `config/application.rb` copies the env vars (falling back to the `active_record_encryption` credentials entry) **into `config.active_record.encryption`**. That matters: the webhook-secret and gateway-customer `encrypts` calls check `Rails.configuration.active_record.encryption`, so keys that live only in credentials, without that snippet, leave those two columns plaintext. Apps from an older starter need the snippet (see `spree-upgrade-5-to-6`).
  - **Never change or lose the keys** once data is encrypted. Rails can rotate the primary key, but not the deterministic key/salt the webhook secrets and gateway customer IDs use.
  - Turning encryption on for existing data: identity tokens stay readable (`support_unencrypted_data: true`) and encrypt on next write. Webhook secrets and gateway customer IDs don't — set `config.active_record.encryption.support_unencrypted_data = true` and `extend_queries = true`, deploy with the keys, run `[Spree::WebhookEndpoint, Spree::GatewayCustomer, Spree::UserIdentity].each { |m| m.find_each(&:encrypt) }`, then remove both settings.
- **Payment-method and integration preferences are not encrypted.** Gateway credentials live in the serialized `preferences` column, so treat the database and its backups as holding live secrets. Enter live gateway keys through the dashboard (Settings → Payments), not in seeds.

The `spree/agent-skills` plugin ships a hook that warns when an agent writes a known-shape secret (Stripe live keys, AWS keys, PATs). It's a tripwire, not a review.

## API keys

```
pk_*  Publishable. Safe in browser and mobile code. Store API only.
sk_*  Secret. Server-to-server only. Never ship it in a bundle, app or VITE_* variable.
```

- **Minimum scopes.** `spree api-key create --type secret --scopes read_orders,write_fulfillments`. Don't give integrations `write_all`. The scope list is in `spree-api-v3/references/scopes.md`.
- Scopes and channel bindings are **immutable**. To rotate or change access, mint a new key, deploy it, then revoke the old one (Settings → API keys, or `spree api-key revoke`).
- Writes made with a secret key are attributed to that key (`*_type: api_key`), so you can audit what a leaked key did through the actor fields and `WebhookDelivery` logs.
- Bind a storefront's publishable key to its channel so shoppers can't switch channels by sending `X-Spree-Channel`.
- A leaked `pk_` is a nuisance: rate-limit and rotate. A leaked `sk_` is a breach: revoke it, then audit.

## Dashboard and staff sessions

The React dashboard (`@spree/dashboard`, served at `/dashboard` by `spree_dashboard`) holds **no API keys**:

- Staff sign in and the **JWT lives in memory only** (5-minute default lifetime, `admin_jwt_expiration`). The refresh token is an **HttpOnly, signed cookie** scoped to `/api/v3/admin/auth`. JavaScript can't read it, and it rotates on every refresh.
- Over HTTPS the cookie is `SameSite=None; Secure`. Over plain HTTP it falls back to `SameSite=Lax` (dev only).
- **Same-origin** (the default: dashboard served by Rails at `/dashboard`) needs no CORS or cookie configuration.
- **Cross-origin** (dashboard on a CDN): HTTPS on both sides, **and** add the dashboard origin under **Settings → Allowed Origins** (`Spree::AllowedOrigin`, `/api/v3/admin/allowed_origins`). The starter's `config/initializers/cors.rb` consults that table for `/api/v3/admin/*` with `credentials: true`. CSRF protection for the cookie is SameSite plus the strict origin allowlist, so keep the list exact and short.
- **Gating in the UI is not authorization.** The dashboard hides buttons based on `GET /api/v3/admin/me` permission keys, but the API gate enforces them. Any dashboard plugin action must hit an endpoint that declares `scoped_resource` (see `spree-auth-permissions`). Record-level refusals behind that gate come from `Spree.ability_class` — a custom subclass can tighten staff access further, but it never loosens the key gate, and secret keys (`Spree::ApiKeyAbility`) bypass it.
- Staff SSO: register `OidcStrategy` and optionally remove `:email` from `Spree.admin_authentication_strategies`. Staff accounts are never auto-provisioned from the IdP.
- Give every staff member their own account and a least-privilege role. Don't share an `admin@` login.

### Mission Control (`/jobs`)

The jobs UI is protected by HTTP Basic auth. In production set `MISSION_CONTROL_USER` and `MISSION_CONTROL_PASSWORD`; without them the dashboard stays locked. The starter's local defaults (`spree` / `spree123`) apply only in development and test. Never copy them into production env files.

## Store API: IDOR and cross-store leaks

- Carts and orders are readable by their owner (JWT) **or** by whoever holds the guest token (`X-Spree-Token`). Anyone holding the token can read that cart or order, so never log tokens or put them in URLs you share.
- Prefixed IDs are **not secret** (they're encodings of sequential keys). Authorize every lookup; never rely on the ID being hard to guess.
- In custom Store controllers, read through `storefront_access_policy.scope(Model.for_store(current_store))` or through `current_user.<association>`. Never use `Model.find(params[:id])`.
- In custom Admin controllers, use the inherited `scope` (store-scoped) and declare `scoped_resource`. Multi-store apps share one database, so `Spree::Order.find` in a controller is a cross-store leak.
- In development and test, `Spree::StoreScopeGuard` flags `SELECT`s on store-owned tables (any `spree_*` table with `store_id`) that are neither store-scoped nor id-filtered. It watches every API v3 request **and any unit of work that assigns `Spree::Current.store`** — jobs, webhook controllers, console scripts, specs — until `Spree::Current` resets. Mode: `SPREE_STORE_SCOPE_GUARD` / `Spree::Config[:store_scope_guard]` = `log` (default), `raise` (Spree's own API suite), `off`; never active in production. Wrap a deliberately global lookup in `Spree::StoreScopeGuard.skip { … }`. Take its warnings seriously.

## Mass assignment

API v3 controllers build their allowlist from `resource_permitted_attributes` (custom controllers) plus each model's `additional_permitted_attributes`. There is no `Spree::PermittedAttributes` module. Don't override `permitted_params` — that drops what extensions add.

```ruby
# Make an extension column writable on the existing endpoints (never `<<`, the array is frozen):
Spree::Product.additional_permitted_attributes += [:brand_id]
Spree::Address.additional_permitted_attributes += [{ tag_ids: [] }]

# Custom controllers list their own:
def resource_permitted_attributes = %i[name rating body]
```

Never use `params.permit!`. Never permit ownership or privilege columns (`customer_id`, `store_id`, `role_ids`, `status`) on customer-facing endpoints. Set those server-side.

## Injection and XSS

- **SQL:** use parameterized `where('x > ?', v)` or hash conditions, never string interpolation. Ransack is safe because it only filters on allowlisted attributes. Unknown `q[...]` predicates are silently dropped. Expose new filters with `Spree.ransack.add_attribute(Model, :attr)`, and never allowlist secrets or digests.
- **Rich text:** product, category, collection and seller descriptions are sanitized **on save** by `Spree::RichTextSanitizer` (via `has_spree_rich_text` / `sanitizes_rich_text`). The allowlist covers what the dashboard's Tiptap editor emits: `p br hr h1–h6 strong em s u code pre blockquote ul ol li a img`, and `data:`/`javascript:` URLs are stripped. The API returns `description` as plain text and `description_html` as sanitized markup.
  - To widen the allowlist deliberately: `Spree::RichTextSanitizer.allowed_tags += %w[table thead tbody tr th td]` in an initializer.
  - Writes that skip callbacks (`update_columns`, `update_all`, raw SQL, bulk imports that bypass models) are **not** sanitized. Call `Spree::RichTextSanitizer.sanitize(html)` yourself.
  - New rich-text columns on your models: `include Spree::SanitizableRichText` + `has_spree_rich_text :body`. Translated attributes need `sanitizes_rich_text` on the `Translation` class too.
- **Storefront:** render `*_html` with your framework's raw-HTML escape hatch (for example, React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) only for these server-sanitized fields. Escape everything else.
- **CSV exports:** neutralize cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` before writing files that staff open in spreadsheets.

## CORS and CSP

```ruby
# config/initializers/cors.rb: storefront on another origin (the admin block comes from the starter)
allow do
  origins 'https://shop.example.com'
  resource '/api/v3/store/*', headers: :any, methods: %i[get post patch put delete options]
end
```

- Never use `origins '*'` together with `credentials: true`. The admin, and a cross-origin seller panel, must use the Allowed Origins table.
- Set CSP on the app that renders HTML. For a Next.js storefront that means the Next app, not Rails. The Rails side mainly serves JSON plus the dashboard.

## Webhooks

**Outbound** (Spree → your receiver). Each delivery carries `X-Spree-Webhook-Signature` = hex HMAC-SHA256 of `"#{timestamp}.#{raw_body}"` using the endpoint's secret, plus `X-Spree-Webhook-Timestamp` and `X-Spree-Webhook-Event`. **Receivers must:**

1. Verify against the **raw** body bytes, before JSON parsing.
2. Compare with a constant-time function (`ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare`, `crypto.timingSafeEqual`).
3. Reject timestamps older than about 5 minutes (replay).
4. Be idempotent. HTTP errors and timeouts are recorded on the delivery without an automatic retry, but an exception escaping `Spree::Webhooks::DeliverWebhook` makes `Spree::WebhookDeliveryJob` retry (up to 5 attempts), and a manual redelivery sends the same event again.

`@spree/sdk/webhooks` exports `verifyWebhookSignature(rawBody, signature, timestamp, secret, tolerance = 300)`. See `spree-events-webhooks`.

**SSRF.** Outside development, deliveries go through `SsrfFilter`, which blocks private, loopback and link-local targets. Development bypasses it so `localhost` receivers work. Don't copy `Rails.env.development?` branches into other code paths. `webhooks_verify_ssl` defaults to on outside development; leave it on. Creating webhook endpoints requires `write_webhooks`, which is deliberately separate from `settings`.

**Inbound** (gateway → Spree, e.g. `/api/v3/webhooks/payments/...`): the payment provider verifies the gateway's signature and returns 401 when it's invalid. If you write a custom provider, verify the signature before acting (see `spree-providers`, `spree-payments`).

## Data privacy (GDPR)

- **Subject requests** are `Spree::DataRequest` records. Customers create them with `POST /api/v3/store/customers/me/data_requests { kind: "access" | "erasure" }` (erasure requires `current_password`). Staff use `GET /api/v3/admin/customers/:id/export` and `POST /api/v3/admin/customers/:id/anonymize`. Exports are built in the background and emailed as expiring signed links.
- **Erasure means anonymization**, done by the `Spree::Customers::Anonymize` workflow. It scrubs the account, address book, order address snapshots, saved cards, identities, sessions and consent rows. It keeps financial records (orders, payments, tax lines, line items, plus country, state and a truncated postcode for tax jurisdiction), and publishes `customer.anonymized`.
- **If you add a table holding personal data, extend anonymization in the same change.** Core has a schema-guard spec that fails when a personal-data column isn't covered.
- Hooks:
  ```ruby
  Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
    Spree.hooks.register('customers.anonymize.validate', 'MyApp::LegalHold')            # workflow.reject!('Under legal hold')
    Spree.hooks.register('data_requests.fulfill.extend_payload', 'MyApp::LoyaltyExport') # return a Hash to merge
  end
  ```
- **Consent:** `Spree::ConsentRecord` records acceptance events (purpose, source, time, document digest). The customer also has `email_marketing_consent_updated_at` / `_source`. Consent rows survive erasure with the contact details removed. Cookie consent is the storefront's responsibility.
- Staff access to `DataRequest` and `ConsentRecord` rides `read_customers` / `write_customers`.

## PCI scope

Spree never stores or transmits PANs. Card data goes browser → gateway through the gateway's hosted fields (Stripe Elements / Payment Element via `spree_stripe`, Adyen Drop-in, PayPal). Spree only receives tokens and payment sessions. `Spree::CreditCard` holds brand, last4, expiry and a gateway reference, never the full number or CVC.

- **Never add card-data columns** or proxy raw card fields through your API. If you think you need to, use gateway tokenization instead.
- With hosted fields only, you're usually at SAQ A. Collecting card data yourself puts you at SAQ D.
- Param filtering already covers `number`, `verification_value` and the like. Extend `Rails.application.config.filter_parameters` for any custom sensitive param names.

## Rate limiting

The API throttles built in: per publishable key + IP (300/min), per secret key (600/min), and per-IP limits on login, registration, refresh and password reset. Counters live in `Rails.cache`, so multi-process deployments need a shared store (Solid Cache or Redis). Put a CDN or WAF in front for volumetric abuse. See `spree-api-v3` for the table.

## Dependency hygiene

Run `bundle audit`, `brakeman`, and `pnpm audit` for the storefront and dashboard in CI. The plugin doesn't ship a CI workflow.

## Deployment checklist

- [ ] Secrets in credentials/env. No secrets in `VITE_*`, in the repo, or in seeds.
- [ ] `secret_key_base` stable; `SPREE_JWT_SECRET_KEY` set; the three `ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_*` keys set (production-only set, backed up) and read into `config.active_record.encryption`.
- [ ] `config.force_ssl = true`; HTTPS on API, dashboard and storefront.
- [ ] Allowed Origins lists only real dashboard/seller-panel origins. Storefront CORS lists explicit origins.
- [ ] `MISSION_CONTROL_USER` / `MISSION_CONTROL_PASSWORD` set.
- [ ] Integrations use minimum-scope secret keys, each named after its purpose. `write_all` reserved for break-glass use.
- [ ] Staff have individual accounts and least-privilege roles. SSO enforced if the org has an IdP.
- [ ] Webhook receivers verify HMAC, check the timestamp, and are idempotent.
- [ ] Custom controllers are store-scoped (Admin) or ownership-scoped (Store).
- [ ] Anonymization covers any personal-data tables you added.
- [ ] Shared cache store for rate limits. CDN/WAF in front.
- [ ] Database backups encrypted and stored away from the DB.
